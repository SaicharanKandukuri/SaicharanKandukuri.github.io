## Early Days

The story happened when it was the dawn of teaching with PPT and when i was totally new teen, the teacher i was so admired of said **"A good teacher never looks at book or PPT while teaching"** and he never let us open our textbooks or any teching stuff, all we had was a note books.

The situation may looked normal ( it really is ) but when i was that age i was so soo easy to get manipulated by the words from the people i respect, from that day anytime i saw a teacher a teacher using PPT and just reading whatever on it i thougth **"That teacher dont know anything, just teaching to live"**

> I know, I know that was a stupid thought, but i was a stupid kid. i got it all wrong.

## The Univ life

Its common that every student who gets to university tend to be more mature and their thougth process is mostly based on their life experiences ( atleast to some extent ) and i was no different, when ever i saw a teacher using PPT i thought **"That teacher dont know anything, just teaching to live"** and i was so sure that i was right so i never used PPT in my class.

> some bad teachers contributed to this thought process too which made me more sure that i was right.

Honestly this feeling sticked to me until my 6 th semester and i until now i never looked to back to fix this mistake in my mind.

Because of this feeling my presentation never included texts in it, all i had a was bunch of images, some pretty animations and headings and subheadings.

Look at this slide, i've covered atleast 2 pages of topic in one slide

> Listen if you were present when i presented some things like this, ( forgive me ) i was a fool.

## The Ppt Remorse

Recently i was studying so many new topics from YouTube and conferences and they use presentation to teach or convey something and there i caugth myself reading the line in slide before i listen to the speaker, i was like **"What the hell am i doing"** and i realized that i was doing the same thing i hated so much, but after some time i relalized:

> "_when a person dont know anything about a topic they tend to read the slide first to understand breif about what they going to hear about and then they listen to the speaker_". ( it happens like a subconcious thing )

This make sense cause knowing the topic is the first step to understand it and the key element of any presentation is to convey the topic to the audience and the one that was always missing in my presentation.

I regret all the things i said to myself. The line **"A good teacher never looks at book or PPT while teaching"** means that a good teacher try to deliver the topic in a way that the audience dont need to read the book or PPT to understand the topic, and i was so wrong to think that a teacher who uses PPT dont know anything about the topic.
