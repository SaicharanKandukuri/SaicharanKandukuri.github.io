[{"content":"Early Days The story happened when was the dawn of teaching with PPT, and when I was a new teenager. The teacher I admired so much said, \u0026ldquo;A good teacher never looks at a book or PPT while teaching,\u0026rdquo; and he never let us open our textbooks or any teaching materials. All we had was a notebook. The situation may have looked normal (it is), but when I was that age, I used to get easily manipulated by the words of people I respected due to my authority bias. From that day on, anytime I saw a teacher using PPT and just reading from it, I thought, \u0026ldquo;That teacher doesn\u0026rsquo;t know anything; they\u0026rsquo;re just teaching to live.\u0026rdquo;\nI know it was a stupid thought, but I was a stupid kid. I got it all wrong.\nThe University life It\u0026rsquo;s common for every student who goes to university to tend to be more mature, and their thought process is mostly based on their life experiences (at least to some extent). I was no different. Whenever I saw a teacher using PPT, I thought, \u0026ldquo;That teacher doesn\u0026rsquo;t know anything; they\u0026rsquo;re just teaching to live,\u0026rdquo; and I was so sure that I was right that I never used PPT in my class.\nSome bad teachers also contributed to this thought process, which made me even more sure that I was right.\nHonestly, this feeling stuck with me until my 6th semester, and I have never looked back to fix this mistake in my mind.\nBecause of this feeling, my presentations never included text. All I had was a bunch of images, some pretty animations, and headings and subheadings.\nLook at this slide i made. I\u0026rsquo;ve covered at least two pages of a topics in one presentation slide.\nListen, if you were present when I presented something like this (forgive me), I was a fool.\nThe Ppt Remorse Recently I was studying so many new topics from YouTube and conferences and they use the presentation to teach or convey something and there I caught myself reading the line in the slide before I listen to the speaker, I was like \u0026ldquo;What the hell am I doing\u0026rdquo; and I realized that I was doing the same thing I hated so much, but after some time I realized:\n\u0026ldquo;when a person doesn\u0026rsquo;t know anything about a topic they tend to read the slide first to understand briefly about what they going to hear about and then they listen to the speaker\u0026rdquo;. ( it happens like a subconscious thing )\nThis makes sense because knowing the topic is the first step to understanding it. The key element of any presentation is to convey the topic to the audience, and that was always missing in my presentations.\nI regret all the things I said to myself.\nThe line \u0026lsquo;A good teacher never looks at a book or PPT while teaching\u0026rsquo; means that a good teacher tries to deliver the topic in a way that the audience doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to read the book or PPT to understand the topic, and I was so wrong to think that a teacher who uses PPT doesn\u0026rsquo;t know anything about the topic.\nMORAL: \u0026ldquo;Do go thinking you are right about something before some background work, you may be wrong\u0026rdquo; ü´†\n","permalink":"https://saicharankandukuri.github.io/posts/the-ppt-remorse/","summary":"A little story of how I was wrong about something I thought I was right about.","title":"The Ppt Remorse"},{"content":"A page to remind me start writing again I know its been a long time since I wrote anything.

Allow it\nNow open your termux and settings in a split screen\nmake sure you can see debug IP address, IP address, and passcode. ( resize it )\nback in termux we need to pair with the debugging service\nadb pair localhost:\u0026lt;connection port\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PassCode\u0026gt; Now connect to the device with\nadb connect localhost:\u0026lt;debug port\u0026gt; if no errors appeared then successfully connected to the device. you can check your device connection by adb devices\ntry repeating previous steps if something happens to work. Settings may turn off wireless debugging sometimes after the first pairing.\nFinally fix phantom issue with this command\nadb \\ shell \\ device_config \\ put activity_manager \\ max_phantom_processes 214181594 adb shell device_config \\ set_sync_disabled_for_tests persistent the above command increases max phantom processes and makes sure it cant be changed android at boot\nüéâ Now you can use termux proot in android 12\nSide Effects Increasing phantom process limit causes more process-heavy apps other than termux to run in the background which could cause performance issues when dealing with games or heavy daily drive usage in mid-range phones.\nwhen you feel the stutter and want to make things back to normal use this command.\nadb shell device_config \\ set_sync_disabled_for_tests none Externel SaicharanKandukuri/termux-android12-phantom-fix : (scripts to fix issue with termux in android 12)\nRandomCoderOrg/ubuntu-on-android (Run Ubuntu with pre-installed Desktop Environments in android/termux with ease!
